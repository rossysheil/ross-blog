In my current role as Head of Startup Partners at Stripe I lead startup partnerships and go-to-market strategy for the startups segment in Europe as the first global hire for this function at the company. I'm deeply entrenched within Europe's startup ecosystem serving as a venture scout and advisor with several London based vc funds. I also mentor founders on commercial strategy and go-to-market at vc funds like Seedcamp and Startupbootcamp.

From 2012 - 2017 I was hired as one of Twitters first international hires holding a wide variety of roles across product, sales and people management leading Twitter's expansion into the UK and across EMEA. I was most recently a key member of senior staff management serving as Head of Mobile where I led Twitter's mobile strategy and product across Europe building the highest revenue producing business unit globally. Prior to Twitter I ran business development and partnerships at a vc-backed startup in consumer technology where I successfully led European expansion into new markets like DACH and NORDICS.
